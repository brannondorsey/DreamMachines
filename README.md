#Dream Machines

Sandbox repo for experimentation using machine learning to hallucinate circuit board schematics. Impenitrable code at the moment, but check back soon for progress updates.

See [`data/sch`](data/sch) for ~4,450 (135MB) schematic files that I scraped using the GitHub API. I Should be able to scrape significantly more in the future if need be.

See [`data/samples`](data/samples) for generated schematic files created using [torch-rnn](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn) ([char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn)).

Files can (sometimes) be opened using KiCad eeschema.

More soon...
